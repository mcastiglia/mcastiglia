# About Me
Hi, my name is Michael. I am currently studying Computer Engineering (VLSI Digital Circuits Track) at the University of Central Florida and am performing research on formal hardware verification in the DRACO Laboratory led by Dr. Mike Borowczak, with support from Advanced Micro Devices.

In my time away from school, I am the UCF IEEE Student Branch's treasurer and enjoy volunteering for FIRST Robotics Competition events.
